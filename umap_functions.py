    is k.

    Parameters
    ----------
    distances: array of shape (n_samples, n_neighbors)
        Distances to nearest neighbors for each sample. Each row should be a
        sorted list of distances to a given samples nearest neighbors.

    k: float
        The number of nearest neighbors to approximate for.

    n_iter: int (optional, default 64)
        We need to binary search for the correct distance value. This is the
        max number of iterations to use in such a search.

    local_connectivity: int (optional, default 1)
        The local connectivity required -- i.e. the number of nearest
        neighbors that should be assumed to be connected at a local level.
        The higher this value the more connected the manifold becomes
        locally. In practice this should be not more than the local intrinsic
        dimension of the manifold.

    bandwidth: float (optional, default 1)
        The target bandwidth of the kernel, larger values will produce
        larger return values.

    Returns
    -------
    knn_dist: array of shape (n_samples,)
        The distance to kth nearest neighbor, as suitably approximated.

    nn_dist: array of shape (n_samples,)
        The distance to the 1st nearest neighbor for each point.
